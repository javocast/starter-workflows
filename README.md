These are the workflow files for helping people get started with GitHub Actions.  They're presented whenever you start to create a new GitHub Actions workflow.

**If you want to get started with GitHub Actions, you can use these starter workflows by clicking the "Actions" tab in the repository where you want to create a workflow.**


**Directory structure:**
* [ci](ci): solutions for Continuous Integration
* [automation](automation): solutions for automating workflows.
* [code-scanning](code-scanning): starter workflows for [Code Scanning](https://github.com/features/security)
* [icons](icons): svg icons for the relevant template

Each workflow must be written in YAML and have a `.yml` extension. They also need a corresponding `.properties.json` file that contains extra metadata about the workflow (this is displayed in the GitHub.com UI).

For example: `ci/django.yml` and `ci/properties/django.properties.json`.

**Valid properties:**
* `name`: the name shown in onboarding
* `description`: the description shown in onboarding
* `iconName`: the icon name in the relevant folder, for example `django` should have an icon `icons/django.svg`. Only SVG is supported at this time
* `categories`: the categories that it will be shown under
